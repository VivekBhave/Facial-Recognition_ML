# Facial-Recognition_ML
My Machine Learning facial recognition project in MATLAB

The code is run on the data.mat dataset.

Run the following codes for respective classifiers from the code folder:
Bayes' classifier: Bayes_face.m
KNN classifier: KNN.m  -> you can change valaue of K at line 31
PCA with Bayes' classifier: PCA_Bayes.m -> you can change number of dimensions at line 50
PCA with KNN classifier: PCA_KNN.m -> you can change number of dimensions at line 49 and K value at line 59
LDA with Bayes' classifier: LDA_Bayes.m -> you can change number of dimensions at line 65
LDA with KNN classifier: LDA_KNN.m -> you can change number of dimensions at line 63 and K value at line 74
Extra Credit: Detecting  state of "happy", "neutral" and "illuminated"


The output of each code is the accuracy displayed in the command window.
